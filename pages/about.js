        <b>Howdy mates!</b> My name is JoÃ£o and I'm an avid lover of just
        programming in general, with a special focus on the Web front-end side,
        having worked previously as a Junior Software Developer. Recently I've
        been focusing on better understanding how <b>React</b> works under the
        hood and better practices to improve on my already existing knowledge of
        it with the help of some courses such as Cassidy's{' '}
        <a href="https://scrimba.com/course/greusablereact/" target="_blank">
          amazing advanced tutorial
        </a>{' '}
        on reusable React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also been looking into mobile development in general more and more
        due to how big the mobile landscape is nowadays, and this is in my
        opinion one of the most precious qualities in this industry: the will to
        learn & change, the curiosity, the ðŸ”¥ <b>inside your soul</b>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in a more calm note, I believe this above is one of my biggest
        qualities, together with the fact that I'm quite a fast learner to a
        point where you can just give me the documentation link to some
        framework I've never worked with, tell me to do something with it and
        I'll get it done <strike>in less than 10 minutes</strike>, maybe not
        with the highest standards from having worked with it for weeks but...{' '}
        <i>damn, Google & StackOverflow are amazing</i>.
